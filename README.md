# AECS (Awareness of Environment, Climate, and Surrounding)

## High-Level Summary
Our project, AECS (Awareness of Environment, Climate, and Surrounding), is an application that fetches data from NASA's AIRS Satellite. This data provides insights about pollution, air quality, and other environmental issues. The information displayed is location-based, aiming to educate users and encourage actions to mitigate environmental problems.

## Final Project
[Live Application](https://aecs.vercel.app/)

## Project Details
AECS is designed to enhance awareness of climate change and pollution. It empowers users by providing relevant environmental data and insights based on their location. Our mission is to disseminate knowledge regarding climate change and pollution while helping people take informed actions.

### Key Metrics Measured
- Temperature
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)
- Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Dust Concentration
- Ozone (O₃)

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Node.js and Python
- **Data Source**: NASA AIRS Satellite HDF files
- **Data Parsing**: Custom logic to extract insights from AIRS data
- **Mapping**: User's coordinates displayed on an interactive map

## Use of Artificial Intelligence
We utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) via the Groq API to provide suggestions for actions that individuals can take to reduce pollution based on the shared data.
